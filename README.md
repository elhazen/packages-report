Workshop challenge checklist
----------------------------

*As you complete tasks, you can ~~cross them out~~ by surrounding with `~~`.*

-   Have a look around the files here. Where are the R scripts? What are the directories `data` and `figs` for?
-   Notice that this README is an `.Rmd` file. That means it could contain R code and will need to be rendered to create `README.md`. ~~\* Open [R/01\_write-installed-packages.R](R/01_write-installed-packages.R). Write the script as directed. Run it. Commit and push the current state.~~ ~~\* Open [R/02\_wrangle-packages.R](R/02_wrangle-packages.R). Fill in the missing pieces of the script as directed. Run it. Commit and push the current state.~~ ~~\* Open [R/03\_barchart-packages-built.R](R/03_barchart-packages-built.R). Fill in the missing pieces of the script as directed. Run it. Commit and push the current state.~~
-   Fill in the blanks below in this README, using the results stored elsewhere.
-   If you get this far, write an R script to run the whole analysis and, perhaps, another script that does a `make clean` style reset.

Overview
--------

The goal of packages-report is to FINISH THIS SENTENCE.

I have `sum(apt_freqtable$n)` add-on packages installed.

Here's how they break down in terms of which version of R they were built under, which is related to how recently they were updated on CRAN.
